# Provenance log

Append-only. Newest at the bottom. Every design input, every session that
touched geometry, and what that session had seen.

## 2026-09-19. Phase 0. Repo created.

- By: Claude (Fable 5.1), session started in `~/picowallet`, on Austin's
  instruction, after he asked how to make a sellable case.
- Contamination statement: this session had, earlier the same day, read the
  picowallet `case/` notes and memory referring to the Zez0000 and Plass
  designs and their derivatives, and had opened the MakerWorld listing page
  for model 3230142 to read its license. It did not open the STLs in this
  session but has their derived measurements in its notes.
- What it wrote: `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `CLAUDE.md`, `PROCESS.md`,
  `SOURCES.md`, `MEASUREMENTS.md`, this file. No `scad/`. No `stl/`.
- Dimensions written: only the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W rows P1 to P10 in
  `MEASUREMENTS.md`, all from the public Pico datasheet mechanical drawing,
  all marked "confirm cal". No LCD board, screen, button, joystick, stack or
  case dimensions were written.
- Decision: all geometry will be produced by fresh sessions started in this
  directory that have not loaded `~/picowallet` or its memory.
- Austin has handled and seen the earlier printed cases. That is the normal
  position of anyone designing a product in a category that already has
  products. The rule for him is the same as for the agents: measure the
  hardware, do not open the other files, write choices down.

## 2026-09-20. Method research.

- By: the same Claude session as Phase 0 (still contaminated, still no geometry).
- Read: Raspberry Pi Pico series documentation page and the Pico 2 STEP link;
  the Waveshare Pico-LCD-1.3 wiki Resources list and schematic PDF (links and
  part labels only, no case content); general 3D scanner and flatbed
  reverse-engineering articles. Did not open any case design.
- Wrote: `research/scanning.md`. Switched the plan from OpenSCAD to build123d
  so the official Pico 2 STEP can be imported. Added the STEP and the
  schematic to allowed sources. Nothing measured, nothing drawn.

## 2026-09-24. Phase 1 measuring and first geometry.

- By: Claude (Opus 5.5), one session started in this directory. It did not
  load `~/picowallet` or its memory, did not open any forbidden path in
  `CLAUDE.md`, and made no web search or web fetch (checked against the
  session transcript on 2026-09-24). Its only contact with `~/picowallet`
  was one `ls -d` checking that the directory exists.
- Inputs used, all logged in `MEASUREMENTS.md` with row IDs:
  - Flatbed scan 01 of Austin's boards, 600 dpi, scale from a steel rule in
    the same scan (`measurements/2026-09-24-scan-01-*`). Our own image.
  - Caliper readings taken by Austin on the bench, read aloud, one iPad
    camera frame saved per reading (`measurements/2026-09-24-cal-*.jpg`).
  - Austin's statements: USB-C at the joystick end (A3); PINK board only;
    snap fit; square caps with a web and a lip.
  - Datasheet: header row spacing 17.78 = 7 x 2.54 (P10), the standard Pico
    pinout, used only to place the sockets and the Pico in the render.
- No third-party geometry. Tools only: build123d (Apache-2.0) generates the
  shapes; three.js (MIT) is loaded from cdnjs by the viewer and not copied in.
- Wrote: `cad/params.py`, `cad/model.py`, `cad/build.py`, `stl/`,
  `renders/viewer.html`, `REPORT.md`, first test print drops.

## 2026-09-24. Independent revision R4, Codex.

- Session started in this repository at Austin's request to critically review
  all measurements and correct or redesign the case. Read this repository's
  documents, code, scan analysis, overlay and caliper photographs. No other
  case listings, geometry, picowallet files or memory were opened. No imported
  third-party geometry. Existing MIT license retained.
- Inputs: the recorded caliper values and scan01 already listed above.
  Photo review identifies evidence limitations; it does not silently replace
  Austin's readings with uncertain image readings. New derived coordinate
  rows and explicit design/verification assumptions are in MEASUREMENTS.md.
- Original engineering changes: clearance between halves, slotted lid snap
  arms, sloped shelf undersides, USB insertion channel with lid closure,
  four PCB hold-down pads, narrower button flanges, and joystick fit samples.
  Choices and remaining physical tests are documented in DESIGN.md/REPORT.md.

## 2026-09-24. R5 captive joystick, Codex.

- Input: Austin's direct feedback from the first physical print. The joystick
  cap must attach to the board before the lid; a lower lip retains it inside
  the case, with a shaft and ball outside. R4's post-lid cap is rejected.
- No external case geometry, photographs, or measurements consulted. Existing
  hardware rows retained; new flange/ball/collar dimensions are original design
  choices D5-JOY. Joystick motion is still an assumed verification envelope.
- Sent a hold request for R4 via the already authorized print inbox workflow.
  Preserve R4 tag/history. R5 changes joystick cap and lid only, with assembly,
  retention and motion checks, matching documentation and rebuilt outputs.
- Additional direct feedback: the first printed case is difficult to open;
  Austin requests a tool notch. Add two original shallow seam notches
  (D5-PRY), preserving the flexible latch bands and underlying wall.

## 2026-09-24. V1 physical feedback and photos, Codex.

- Austin explicitly identifies the photographed case as V1, made from first
  principles without another licensed case. Input is his own printed case,
  not an external enclosure reference. Repo MIT license is unchanged.
- Viewed his uploads paste-f2819d95-IMG_0801.jpg (joystick),
  paste-f925a63a-IMG_0800.jpg (buttons), paste-42cd1b6f-IMG_0799.jpg (USB).
  Saved unchanged in prints/v1-feedback/. No dimensions inferred from the
  perspective photos; no other case sources consulted.
- Additional requested changes: taller/wider rectangular buttons with
  smaller top/bottom lips; smaller USB opening shifted toward lid; bottom
  tool-access hole over pink board button. Button identity, coordinates and
  pad size are not established. These three changes remain pending.
- Saved feedback separately from the R5 joystick/pry CAD checkpoint.
  Physical V1's exact source commit is not established. Preserve all earlier
  commits and tags; do not label the partial draft as ready to print.

## 2026-09-24. V2 candidate from existing scan, Codex.

- Austin explicitly authorizes making a good estimate from the existing pink
  board scan, iterating, completing the next version and sending to printer.
- Revisited scan01 and its original measurement script. Detected the pale
  board button at crop-local (294.0667,409.7847), centre-relative u=13.4370,
  v=-3.2868 mm. Opposite-facing component side requires lateral reflection
  into the LCD-front coordinate frame. Recorded PINK-BTN-SCAN and D5-ACCESS.
- V1 USB photo supports the higher existing A1 placement rather than P15's
  lower placement; selected A1 for shell/aperture but kept conservative
  floor depth. Recorded original button/access/USB trial choices before CAD.
- No third-party case geometry viewed or imported. V2 is the next physical
  print candidate; internal CAD revision remains R5 after its saved checkpoint.

## 2026-09-25. V2 physical review, Codex.

- Input: Austin's direct physical feedback. Pry feature, bottom board-button
  hole alignment and rectangular cap shape worked. V2 joystick does not fit
  PCB stick; raised collar and support layer caused problems at button holes.
  Earlier joystick fit and movement were good.
- Requested correction goals: preserve successful features and earlier
  joystick interface/movement; add internal lip and ball passing through
  opening; restore flat lid, no raised case or problematic supports.
- Austin requested documentation first. Added review/handoff and status
  notices only. No geometry changes, external case references, new hardware
  dimensions or printer actions. Specific socket failure cause and actual
  slicer support construction remain unverified.

## 2026-09-25. V3 browser-review design, Codex.

- Austin reports V2 USB opening aligns but rejects the lid fin/tab and its
  gaps. Restore closed base port style with V2 alignment. Keep working pry
  notches, bottom access and rectangular caps.
- Requests earlier joystick bottom/interface and V2 ball, captured inside a
  flat lid; permits uniform extra lid height and correspondingly taller caps.
  No support layer or raised local collar. Requests interactive browser
  rendering and approval before printing; no printer action authorized now.
- Inspected only this repository's original commits6469436 and4010773.
  Both sockets2.01 and roof5.30 versus V2 socket1.91 and roof5.00. Select
  full-case4010773 lower geometry as explicit provisional V1 baseline;
  exact physical cap source not independently confirmed. No external models.
- Original tapered flange and small ball-top print flat added for support-
  avoiding inverted cap printing; choices logged D6, not hardware readings.

- Final V3 review: flat top4.0 mm higher, original full-case lower shape
  matched by CAD difference checks. Smaller pocket and screen-side web keep
  the joystick relief from opening into the display well. Closed-port
  USB-first assembly checked at19 separate-Pico poses; physical test pending.
- Required geometry checks206 passed;48 intersections with guessed joystick
  body retained as unresolved sensitivity diagnostics rather than changing
  the reported-working earlier neck to satisfy an unmeasured proxy.
- Browser controls tested in local Chromium. Served only renders/ on LAN
  port8765 for user review. No printer interaction. V3 approval remains pending.

## 2026-09-25. Low-lid V3 revision in progress, Codex.

- Austin rejects deep screen recess and requires top at most1 mm above glass.
  Explicitly asks to proceed now. No additional outside geometry consulted.
- D7 tests original side-arm retention around joystick body, retaining earlier
  socket. Button underside relief allows retaining wings below plunger top.
  Measurements unchanged; these are trial constructions requiring checks.
- Five-degree motion is a chosen trial, not established hardware travel;
  retain larger-angle failures explicitly. No print authorized or requested.

- D7 side tabs failed16 ten-degree lid-motion cases; saved as failed
  checkpoint. D8 tests one rear tab beyond PCB edge, using that available
  space rather than adding lid height. Original profile/pocket recorded
  before modelling. No new hardware measurements or outside designs.

- D8 refinement shifts/reprofiles the rear heel and pocket, preserving the
  original lower socket. A small PCB interference in one10-degree pressed
  pose prompted extra relief at the heel's lower edge; full original
  10-degree lid scenarios remain required, not weakened to get a pass.
- Added cap/base, cap/PCB and new rear-arm/fixed-hardware motion checks.
  Button wings are lowered beside switch bodies to retain the1 mm screen
  recess; plunger contact height and outside rectangular shape retained.
- Dedicated review builder updates browser files only; old print artifacts
  are untouched and explicitly labelled obsolete for this geometry.

- Final D8 review:495 required checks pass, including the full10-degree
  lid/base/PCB scenarios and new-arm versus fixed hardware. Inherited48
  guessed-body/neck intersections remain unresolved. Browser render and
  interactions tested; source and listed output hashes verified. No print
  artifacts generated, no printer action. Slicing, thin-junction strength
  and actual hardware movement still need verification after review.

## 2026-09-25. J1 isolated round-lip fit test, Codex.

- Austin supplied IMG_0810, IMG_0811 and IMG_0812 as side photos of his
  hardware in this ongoing fit discussion. Used qualitatively only: body
  and screen tops look similar; perspective photos are not caliper readings.
- Austin rejected D8 rear arm and rectangular opening. Requests ball through
  round hole, wider circular lip underneath, original socket, small test only.
- Latest instruction: prepare CAD viewer, STL and review note for Claude Code.
  No printing in this turn. No outside geometry used; original MIT design.
- J1 dimensions below are explicit design trials, not new measurements.

## 2026-09-25. J1 physical feedback, Codex.

- Austin supplies IMG_0814 showing his printed J1 cap/gauge on his board.
  Reports full motion when hand-held, but gauge too flimsy for confidence.
  No numerical measurement inferred from photo. Original user fit evidence.
- Requests actual lid for existing printed base, retaining unchanged J1 cap.
  Base revision unresolved; no outside designs consulted or geometry changed.

## 2026-09-25. V3 fitted shell, Codex.

- Austin resolves scope: new base with closed V1-style USB aperture at V2's
  working USB position/size, no USB lid fin; new complete lid using existing
  V2 buttons and unchanged physically tested J1 joystick. Explicitly asks
  to send only these two shell parts. Retain pry and bottom access features.
- Inputs: own prototype-v2 source and parameters, current own base/snap
  geometry, J1 cap/gauge, and Austin's reported free hand-held movement.
  No third-party geometry, no new measured dimensions. Original MIT work.
- Lid screen rim remains z3.05; local joystick roof copies J1 z4.4..5.1,
  button region copies V2 z4.6. Upright lid printing proposed to avoid the
  previous raised-top/support-layer failure; operator must review bridges
  and overhangs, and hold rather than add supports or a raft.

## 2026-09-25. V3 flat-face correction, Codex.

- Austin explicitly rejects upright lid printing. Authorizes raising the
  entire face to the joystick's required height for this fit trial, face-down
  with NO supports. Requests immediate print after confirming instructions.
- Keep underside retention at J1 z4.4; entire outer face z5.1. Reuse existing
  base, buttons and joystick. No new hardware measurements or outside inputs.
- This explicitly supersedes the prior1 mm screen-depth constraint for this
  iteration. Button protrusion reduces .5 mm to1.3 mm with unchanged caps.

## 2026-09-25. Matching V3 base print request, Codex.

- Austin reports flat lid looks great and requests matching V3 base.
  Reused unchanged existing base mesh; no new measurements or geometry.
  User report confirms lid print, not yet assembled snap/joystick fit.

## 2026-09-25. J2 stepped socket, Codex.

- Austin supplies his hardware photos IMG_0822..IMG_0827, requesting lower
  cap seating, eventually lower flat lid and a small hole-centre correction.
  Photos show round stem collar below square shaft. Caliper display3.32 mm
  is visible but feature identification remains unconfirmed, not substituted
  for the explicitly requested trial diameter.
- Austin reports collar height less than1 mm, explicitly specifies socket:
  circleØ3 mm for first1 mm, existing square for next2 mm. Existing square
  is2.01 mm across flats. No added diameter allowance silently applied.
- Austin offers printing just the joystick first. Selected this scoped fit
  trial: unchanged outer J1 cap, deeper stepped cavity, no lid/base edits.
  All geometry original from this repository; no external cases consulted.

## 2026-09-25. V3 record photos, Claude (Opus 5.5).

- Austin supplies IMG_0814, IMG_0817, IMG_0822, IMG_0827 "for the record
  books" while working on V3, and asks that the whole process be documented
  from first principles so the design ships MIT with no non-commercial
  licence entanglement.
- Saved byte-identical to `prints/v3-photos/` with hashes and a per-photo
  description. Austin's own photos of this repo's own prints and his own
  boards; MIT with the repo. No third-party design in any frame.
- Record only: no dimension taken from these photos; nothing in `cad/`
  changed. This session opened no forbidden source and no picowallet file.
### 2026-09-25 — J3 / lowered flat lid trial

Austin's own J2 print feedback and two IMG_0828 photos (upload prefixes
961919fc and 583f9050): round socket too tight; request diameter 3.5 mm,
depth 1.1 mm, retain deeper square. Lip estimated 0.4 mm above glass.
Authorized printing a new lid and joystick together and progressively lowering
the lid until motion restricts, then backing off. Photos inspected directly;
not calibrated measurements. Codex input; user-owned hardware/photos, no
third-party case geometry. Original design choices below are trial values.
## 2026-09-25 — J2 restore / further 1.5 mm lowering request

Austin reports J3 socket failed; selects immediately preceding J2 unchanged.
Reports roughly 1.5 mm available joystick clearance and authorizes lowering
latest lid by 1.5 mm and printing lid plus J2. Input is his own physical fit
feedback. Codex inspected only original repository sources. No third-party
geometry. Preflight finds existing button retention incompatible with requested
uniform height; no geometry modified or print submitted pending direction.
## 2026-09-25 — L2 one-millimeter roof translation, authorized fit trial

Austin changes the reduction to 1.00 mm and explicitly accepts a possibly
unsuccessful physical fit: keep roof thickness, move it down, print it.
Reuse unchanged J2 joystick, same base/buttons. Source: own printed hardware
feedback in this conversation. Codex uses only original repository geometry;
no external cases. CAD interference is reported, not treated as fit success.
## 2026-09-25 — L3 hole alignment / restore L1 height

Austin reports L2 cannot close with joystick/buttons installed. Requests
previous L1 height restored and hole moved at least 1 mm toward LCD; print
lid only. Own photos IMG_0831/0830/0829 (upload prefixes f4ab2501, 428b66fa,
f0156714) inspected directly. Stem appears LCD-ward of opening centre.
Use explicitly requested 1.00 mm, not a calibrated measurement from photos.
Codex uses original repository CAD only; no third-party case access.
## 2026-09-25 — L4 halfway-back alignment

Austin identifies own IMG_0832 as previous and IMG_0833 as latest L3;
latest opening overshoots, asks halfway back and slightly up. Photos inspected
directly (upload prefixes d7fdddb0, f938ec3c). Choose +0.50 CAD Y from L3,
and +0.30 CAD X (photo up with LCD on right). Lateral amount is an original
trial choice, not a calibrated photo measurement. No third-party geometry.
## 2026-09-25 — S1 strong shell / lower seam

Austin reports lid bends during removal from print plate; own IMG_0834 shows
side clip slots/windows and pry cutout. Requests stronger case/joint, no side
slots, exactly one pry notch, visible upper shell about two-thirds and base
one-third. Retain latest L4 joystick alignment. Codex inspected own photo and
original repository CAD only. New wall/joint dimensions are original design
choices, not hardware measurements. No third-party geometry introduced.
## 2026-09-25 — S1 full-set print approval

Austin approves interactive S1 review and explicitly requests immediate full
case print including joystick/buttons. Package unchanged S1 shells, exact J2
joystick and existing V2 buttons: seven parts total. No geometry changes.
Codex uses HTTP inbox skill; no credentials or private endpoints in repo.
## 2026-09-25 — S1 history photograph and evidence audit

Austin supplies his own IMG_0839 as a historical photo and requests saving to
GitHub, then auditing the development/licensing record. Saved public copy in
prints/s1-photos with EXIF/Photoshop metadata removed losslessly; decoded
pixels identical, original/public hashes recorded, original upload untouched.
Shows shells and five caps on printer bed; not a measurement or fit result.
Codex consulted this repository and official general copyright/MIT/patent
references only, not forbidden case sources or other case designs. Audit is
an evidence assessment, not a comparative design review or legal clearance.
## 2026-09-25 — S2 tighter base and rounded buttons

Austin reports S1 nearly fits, but base hangs roughly 0.25 mm when held by
lid and opens too easily. Buttons feel too close/indistinct. Requests stronger
flush closure, preferably reprint only one half, and slightly taller rounded
button tops, another print iteration in PLA before PETG/color experiments.
Inputs are his physical test feedback, not new caliper measurements. Codex
uses original S1 and V2 geometry only; no third-party cases. S2 changes base
catches and button tops while preserving S1 lid and J2 joystick.
## 2026-09-25 — assembled S1 album photo

Austin supplies own IMG_0840 twice (56146ab1 and fed322ed upload prefixes).
SHA256 confirms identical originals. Save one metadata-stripped public copy
in prints/s1-photos with original/public hashes and unchanged pixel check.
Image shows assembled case; no dimension derived. Records S1 physical
baseline before tighter-base/rounded-button S2, not an S2 test result.
## 2026-09-25 — v1.0 production release

Austin tested the printed S2 base and buttons with the S1 lid and J2 joystick
and said "This works." He asked for three final nudges of about 0.25 mm each
and said not to print them in PLA. He asked to save the result as version 1.0,
the first production version, under MIT, before printing sets in PETG.
- Joystick hole: 0.25 mm toward the USB-C end, away from the LCD.
- Reset hole in the base: 0.25 mm away from the USB-C end, toward the centre.
- USB-C opening: 0.25 mm toward the top (the lid).
These numbers are his hand estimates, not caliper readings (rows V1-*).

Austin sent five of his own photos: IMG_0844 (USB-C end), IMG_0848 (joystick
hole close-up), IMG_0849 and IMG_0852 (assembled case), and IMG_0854 (the
final case on top of the discarded prototypes). They are saved without
metadata in prints/v1.0-photos. They show direction only; no dimension was
taken from them.

The work was done by Claude (Anthropic) in a new session started in this
repository. Codex had stopped partway with a login error. Austin pasted
Codex's session log from this repo, and Claude read only that log, this
repository's files and his photos. Claude did not open any forbidden source,
any other case design, or anything in ~/picowallet. There is no new
third-party geometry. cad/v1_production.py builds on the S2 and S1 sources
in this repository.
## 2026-09-25 — v1.1 USB-end spacer

Austin tested the PETG v1.0 prints (black base, white lid, gray caps). His
words: it "works really well", but the board stack slides left and right
inside the case, and it lines up best pushed fully to the right. He estimates
the play at more than 1 mm, about 1.2 mm, and asked for about 1.2 mm to be
taken out on the joystick's left, in both the base and the lid. Claude asked
which wall he meant, and he chose the USB-C end wall. The CAD model predicts
only 0.6 mm of play; the design follows his physical reading and records the
difference. The spacer is 1.0 mm, so 0.2 mm stays free. The geometry is
original (cad/v1_1_spacer.py), with no outside inputs and no forbidden
sources opened.
## 2026-09-25 — v1.2 half spacer

Austin found that the v1.1 lid spacer is in the right place but too big: the
screen board will not sit flush. He asked for half as much, 0.5 mm.
cad/v1_1_spacer.py gained configure(rev, spacer); the v1.1 STLs regenerate
byte-identical. cad/v1_2_half_spacer.py builds v1.2 with 0.5 mm. There are no
new outside inputs.
## 2026-09-25 — v1.3 short USB end

Austin rejected the spacer approach, because the lip and the base stops meant
reprinting both halves anyway. He asked instead for the USB-C end wall to
move 0.5 mm inward on both halves, making the case shorter. cad/v1_3_short_end.py
rebuilds v1.0 with the end datums (Y1, IY1) moved 0.5 mm. A check shows both
parts are identical to v1.0 for y < 51. The v1.1 and v1.2 spacer designs are
kept as history and are not used. There are no new outside inputs.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.3 promoted to current best

Austin tested the printed v1.3 lid and base: "holds the case just right,
nothing rattles, everything clicks." He named it the best version so far and
asked for a stable reference the print Mac can use for batches.
stl/current/ holds byte copies of the tested v1.3 lid and base, the v1.0 J2
joystick and a button, plus a full-set plate. There is no new geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.4 rounded-edge look trial

Austin asked for a v1.4 with the edges around the LCD and around the top
rounded, and for a 3D render to review before printing.
cad/v1_4_rounded.py fillets the v1.3 lid's top perimeter (1.5 mm) and the LCD
window edge (0.7 mm). It only removes material, and the base and caps are
unchanged. The radii are original choices; there are no outside inputs. The
lid has not been printed.
Same day, review 4: Austin said the screen's black border can be covered, and
asked for the opening to come in "a little bit all the way around". The
window is 1.0 mm smaller per side, a bezel ring sits 0.3 mm above the glass,
and the edge is re-rounded 1.2 mm. These are original choices; the border
width is not measured. A screenshot review caught a 0.15 mm skin that closed
the window in one intermediate build. It was fixed, and a
"window_open_down_to_glass" check now guards it.
## 2026-09-26 — J4 flat-top joystick, v1.4 lid saved

Austin confirmed the v1.4 lid is the direction and asked to save it, then
explained that the joystick has a press-in click that the round ball makes
hard to hit. He asked for a ball that is flat on top. cad/joystick_j4.py cuts
a 5 mm flat pad into J2's ball and softens its rim; the socket and ball
centre are unchanged. Original geometry; there are no outside inputs. It is
shown in the v1.4 viewer and has not been printed.
J4 review 2 (same day): Austin liked the flat and asked for it bigger, with "a
little hat". The ball now narrows to a 5.5 mm waist, flares out at 45° to a
7 mm disc, and ends in a flat top of about 6 mm. The height is back to J2's.
Original geometry.
J4 review 3 (same day): Austin preferred the plain ball and asked for it cut
flat at its widest point, then bigger, "just barely" through the lid hole,
and flat all the way across. The ball is now 7.4 mm, cut through its centre,
with a 0.3 mm edge break. A new check reruns the J1-CHECK tilt scenarios
against the v1.4 lid and fails on any contact J2 did not have. That ruled out
7.6 and 7.5 mm. Original geometry.
Austin approved J4 and sent it to print (gray PETG, drop
20260926-112324-joystick). He also supplied a screenshot of the v1.4 viewer
for the record. It is saved as renders/v1.4/screenshot-2026-09-26.png with
the metadata removed and the pixels unchanged. It is a render of our own
model, not a design input.
J4 socket bug (2026-09-26): Austin's photos showed a messy, non-working J4
socket. Claude found that the bigger ball filled the top 1.5 mm of the square
socket; that was Claude's CAD error, not a print fault. It is fixed by
re-cutting the J2 socket, with a new check that the socket void is identical
to J2. Photos are archived in prints/v1.4-photos.
## 2026-09-26 — J5 press-in room

Austin found that the joystick's centre click works with the cap off but not
with it on. He asked for the socket to narrow sooner so the cap rides higher.
cad/joystick_j5.py shortens the round mouth by LIFT and keeps the 2.0 mm square
grip; the outside is identical to J4. The tilt checks showed that raising the
cap brings the flange closer to the lid, which costs tilt room, so two test
caps are provided (lift 0.3 and 0.5). The fixed J4 file (as sent) is kept as
stl/v1.4/joystick-j4-fixed.stl. Original geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — J6 clean-press test set

Austin: with the cap on, the centre press also triggers a direction, and J5
did not fix it. Claude's reading is that the cap rocks on the stem (2.01
socket on a 1.86 stem) and that off-centre pushes on the wide flat tip the
stick. cad/joystick_j6.py makes three variants: A (1.95 socket), B (1.90) and
C (1.95 plus a thumb dish), marked by 1/2/3 flange notches. Original
geometry; there are no outside inputs.
## 2026-09-26 — J7 printable socket

After the J6 stringing photo, Austin pointed out that his stick measurements
were already in the repo (J4 1.86 stem, J4b 2.94 lip, J6 5.00 tip height).
Claude had not looked first. cad/joystick_j7.py rebuilds the J6 A/B/C sockets
with no flat overhang, a round-to-square 45° funnel and a pyramid roof, and a
check that finds no downward face steeper than 45° inside the socket.
Original geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — J8 variations on J7-B

Austin: B fits best, A is worse, and with B a direction push sometimes also
clicks the centre. He asked for three more like B. cad/joystick_j8.py changes
one thing each: a smaller flange, a smaller flange plus riding higher, or a
rounder top edge. Original geometry.
J9 (2026-09-26): Austin liked J8-3's round edge and B's hole. Claude checked
that they have identical sockets, and made J9 (J8-3 without notches) to print
in triplicate to separate print variation from design. Original geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.4 lid crush ribs

Austin wanted the lid and base to hold together better without reprinting
the bases. Claude proposed crush ribs, and Austin said to take the best guess
and print one lid. There are 12 ribs, 0.15 mm interference, in the lid skirt
only (cad/v1_4_rounded.py). The checks show contact with the base only at the
ribs, and the ribs clear the catches and the pry notch. The earlier no-rib
v1.4 lid STL (SHA 30596150…, printed 2026-09-26) stays in git history at
c2425d0. Original geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.5 taller lid

Austin found that J9 clicks the centre on direction pushes only when the lid
is on, and asked for a slightly taller lid. The CAD tilt check showed the J9
flange reaching the roof underside. cad/v1_5_tall.py stretches the ribbed
v1.4 lid 0.5 mm above the board hold-down. It also thickens the button cap
flanges by 0.5 and rounds the joystick hole edge by 0.6. Austin stopped the
queued ribbed v1.4 lid before it printed. Original geometry; base unchanged.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.5 promoted to current best

Austin tested the v1.5 lid with the printed v1.3 base, J9 and the original
buttons, and said everything works. He asked for this set to be saved as the
latest. The v1.5 button variant was removed (the original S2 caps are used).
stl/current/ holds byte copies of the tested files; cad/current.py checks
each one against its source. Tagged v1.5. There is no new geometry.
## 2026-09-26 — v1.6 smooth top edge

Austin found a rough line at the v1.5 lid's top edge. The cause is Claude's
design: printed face down, the 3 mm fillet starts flat at the bed. v1.6
fills that start to a 45° tangent band (cad/v1_4_rounded.py TOP_BEVEL, built
by cad/v1_6_bevel.py). The rest is v1.5. Two geometry slips (a cut that
removed nothing, and a fill that was too narrow and too deep) were caught by
the checks before any file left. Original geometry.
## 2026-09-27 — v1.7 locking case

Austin: the case opens too easily, so do all three proposals and redesign the
whole case. cad/v1_7_lock.py makes 0.5 mm hooks with a gentler ramp, adds two
end catches (6 total) and keeps only the base half of the pry slot. The lid
is v1.6 with new pockets. The base is v1.3 with new catches. J9 and the
buttons are unchanged. Original geometry; there are no outside inputs.
Same day: Austin reported a rough edge on the button side of the LCD opening.
It is the same face-down overhang as the outer edge. The v1.7 lid now fills
the window and joystick fillet starts to 45° (R.HOLE_BEVEL, T5.JOY_BEVEL).
The v1.7 lid was re-dropped; the base is unchanged. Original geometry.
2026-09-29 J10 joystick set (cad/joystick_j10.py, cad/j10_tilt.py): four
variants on J9 with tabs or a lower ride, Roman numerals engraved on top.
Original geometry from J9 and Austin's report of a double click; no outside
inputs.
2026-09-30 J11 joystick set (cad/joystick_j11.py): J9 with a square flange
(8.0 or 7.2 across the flats, two turns), numerals I-IV. Austin's design
direction; original geometry from J9; no outside inputs. j10_tilt.py now
exposes tilt() for reuse.
2026-09-30 J12 joystick set (cad/joystick_j12.py): J11-III with lift
0.4-0.7, numerals V-VIII. J10.strokes/mark and J11.cap take optional size and
lift arguments; J10 and J11 STLs rebuild byte-identical. Original geometry,
no outside inputs.
2026-09-30 J13 joystick set (cad/joystick_j13.py): J11-III square at lift
0.55-0.70 with the flange thinned under the lid, and two thinned round discs
(8.6, 8.8); bold letters H T L X O E. Original geometry, no outside inputs.
2026-09-30 J14 joystick set (cad/joystick_j14.py): J13-O with square grip
1.85/1.90/1.95, marked 1-3 dots. Original geometry, no outside inputs.
2026-09-30 J15 (cad/joystick_j15.py): J14-2 without dots; now stl/current/joystick.stl. Original geometry.
2026-09-30 J16 (cad/joystick_j16.py): J15 with a square-only socket and four diagonal flares. Original geometry, no outside inputs.
2026-09-30 J17 (cad/joystick_j17.py): five J16 variants, tabs 1.3-2.3x and hole 0-0.2 shallower, dice-dot marks. Original geometry, no outside inputs.
2026-09-30 J18 (cad/joystick_j18.py): J17-B tabs, hole depth 2.2-1.7, dots 1-6; J4c = Austin's ~2 mm tip-to-collar estimate. Original geometry.
2026-09-30 J19 (cad/joystick_j19.py): J18 at depths 1.6-1.2. Original geometry.
2026-09-30 J20 (cad/joystick_j20.py): J19-2 with a 3.2 x 0.5 round mouth and funnel, 1.5 total depth. Original geometry.
2026-09-30 J21 (cad/joystick_j21.py): J20 at depth 1.9 / 2.0, dots 1/2; J20.cap takes depth and dots (J20 STL rebuilds identical). Original geometry.
2026-09-30 J22 (cad/joystick_j22.py): J21-1 without the dot; now stl/current/joystick.stl. Original geometry.

## 2026-10-01 — Jason's Pico pin spacer + I2C variant (fork session)

- By: Claude (Opus 5.5) for Jason McPheron, in his fork, on a branch from
  upstream main (ef8ea69). Seen this session: this repo and Jason's file only.
  No third-party case, no ~/picowallet, no web pages.
- Input: `inputs/2026-10-01-jason-pico-spacer.step`, Jason's original design
  (Onshape "Part Studio 1 - Part 6", exported 2026-10-01T20:06:14Z), SHA256
  8319309b4b510ec4128f9be43da630fcca887caee2540161a71941140802430e. Dimensions
  from his own calipers. Contributed by Jason under the repo's MIT licence;
  committed unchanged as the record. Not third-party geometry.
- Jason's choices: snap the holes to the datasheet grid (P9, P10); extra tabs
  at pins 6 (GP4), 7 (GP5), 36 (3V3), 38 (GND); pin 1 top-right seen from the
  header side (his board); dot + arrow orientation mark.
- What: `cad/pico_pin_spacer.py` rebuilds his file from rows JS-* (checked
  equal to the STEP) and builds the corners and I2C variants on the grid.
  JS-TIGHT (r 0.8 junctions at the 1.78 gaps) and JS-MARK are original.
