# Measurements

Every number the design uses lives here first. Rows have an ID. `cad/` cites
the ID. Blank means not measured yet. Units are mm.

Sources: `cal` = caliper on the bench, three readings, photo in
`measurements/` where useful. `ds` = datasheet or drawing, name the document
and page. When cal and ds disagree, write both and say which we use.

## Boards

There are several Pico-footprint boards on the bench and they differ: micro-USB
vs USB-C, connector overhang, component heights, sometimes hole positions. Each
board gets its own scan, its own caliper rows and its own photo set. The case
either fits all of them or has a base per board, decided in `DESIGN.md` once
the numbers are in.

Board register. Add a row when a new board shows up. The tag prefixes its rows
and files (`P2W-P11`, `measurements/P2W-P11-usb-overhang.jpg`).

| Tag | Board | USB | Marking / colour | Chip | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P2W | Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W, official | micro-USB | green | RP2350 | official Pico 2 STEP applies |
| PINK | USB-C clone, pink | USB-C | pink | RP2040 | no CAD exists, measure everything |
| | | | | | add more here |

## P. Pico-footprint board rows. One copy per board tag.

Datasheet values below are from the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W datasheet, mechanical
drawing section, and apply to P2W only. Confirm each with calipers. Copy this
table once per tag; clones must not inherit the datasheet numbers.

### Scan 01 results, LCD top side (2026-09-24). Source `scan01` = `measurements/2026-09-24-scan-01-all-boards-600dpi.jpg`, fit in `2026-09-24-scan-01-analysis.json`, overlay `2026-09-24-scan-01-lcd-top-fit.png`, code `tools/measure_scan.py`

Scale 23.666 px/mm from 196 rule ticks over 196 mm, fit RMS 0.73 px (0.031 mm); nominal 600 dpi would be 23.622. Origin: see "Chosen corner" below. Outline edges are blurred where the board sits off the glass, so outline rows carry ±0.3 mm until calipers confirm; centres of features that touched the glass (plungers, stem, glass) are good to ~0.1 mm.

## B. Buttons, four tact switches

Measure the switch, not a cap. Identify the part if you can from the marking or
the schematic and add its datasheet to `SOURCES.md`.

One block per board tag. The hat is the same; the Pico under it changes.

So the USB-C shell stands ~2.4 above the Pico PCB. `measurements/2026-09-24-cal-PINK-A1-stack-glass-to-usbc-1.jpg`, `...-pcb-back-{1,2}.jpg` |

## Chosen corner

State here which corner of the LCD board is the origin for all x, y values,
looking at the screen, and which direction is +x and +y. Use the same origin in
`cad/params.py`.

Origin (chosen 2026-09-24): looking at the screen with the joystick at the top
and the four buttons at the bottom, the FPC tape is on the right. Origin is
the bottom-left corner of the LCD PCB. +x to the right (26.44 wide), +y up
toward the joystick (52.50 long, after calipers). The 600 dpi scan is not mirrored (the
rule's digits and the Pico's silkscreen read correctly), so scan x, y map
straight onto this frame.

## R4 audit: derived coordinates and evidence limits

The scan's absolute corner coordinates above used its blurred 26.5835 ×
52.6773 outline. CAD preserves offsets from the fitted board centre and
uses the caliper outline. These are a registration assumption, not new
caliper readings. Do not scale feature spacing to fit the caliper outline.

| ID | Dimension | Value | Source / limitation |
|---|---|---|---|
| SC1 | Glass centre offset x, y | -0.1393, -0.2905 | scan01 JSON glass_centre_uv, reordered v,u |
| BC1 | Button centre offsets x, y, Y/X/B/A | (-8.4400,-22.1949), (-2.7159,-22.3382), (2.8723,-22.3153), (8.5746,-22.2187) | scan01 plungers_uv, reordered v,u; retain individual y values |

| JC2 | Silver base centre offset x, y | 0.2730, 19.4936 | scan01 joystick_base_centre_uv; blurred; differs from stem by 0.505 mm |
| H1 | Header body width/length | 2.54 / 50.8 | provisional render envelope from P9 × 1 / 20; actual plastic and solder envelope unmeasured |
| H2 | Pico corner radius / USB inward depth | 1.0 / 7.0 | inherited render assumptions, not measurements |
| H3 | Silver base orientation / height | 45 degrees / 3.0 | inherited render assumptions, not measurements |
| H4 | PCB corner radius | 1.5 | inherited render only; collision checks also use a sharp rectangle |
| H5 | Blue flag thickness / inboard overlap | 0.3 / 1.0 | inherited illustrative envelope; identity unresolved |

Photo audit: L3's frame shows no board or caliper; S3 and B6 miss the
measurement contact; L7's frame is not a reliable picture of the recorded
10.66 datum. B4's display appears 3.06 rather than recorded 3.00; B2's second
display appears 4.31 rather than 4.30. A1 photos do not unambiguously show
glass contact, so A2 inherits a datum uncertainty as well as the known USB
0.84 discrepancy. PINK-P11 comes from a segmentation that also reports a
20.95-mm USB width (inconsistent with P12 8.87); its ±0.2 claim is not
independently established. Retain all original readings pending recheck.

### R4 design choices (not hardware measurements)

| ID | Choices in mm unless stated | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D4-FIT | mating gap 0.20; skirt 0.80; wall 2.20; bump 0.45 × 4 × 1; flexible band span 14; slot 0.60; band roof z=-0.30 | maintain 1.20 tongue; outward flex/release access; bands anchored at both ends to bridge when printed inverted |
| D4-SUPPORT | shelf bearing thickness 0.80, 45-degree underside; pad 1.60, inset 0.50, gap 0.05; shelf gap 0; pocket radius 0.50 | slope from wall to shelf tip; four pads land above side shelves outside switches; sharp corner sensitivity |
| D4-BUTTON | flange 5.00; pocket margin 0.30 | avoid neighbouring flanges colliding when each cap slides sideways by 0.25; no overtravel stop until casing and PCB landing areas are confirmed |
| D4-USB | channel clearance 0.25 for lid fin; shell opening square corners; inherited plug trial 12.5 × 7, recess 1.0 | square envelope contains both rectangular shell bounds; insertion straight down |
| D4-JOY | socket total clearance 0.05 (samples 0, 0.10, 0.20); tip clearance 0; engagement 1.20; disc gap 1.80; hole 12.80; disc 14.0 | seat cap on stem, improve tilt/press room over assumed body and base offset clearance; fit samples are provisional |
| D4-CAD | boolean overlap 0.01; cutter extension 1; bump overlap 0.20; window end clearance 0.30; cavity radius 0.50; window/pocket radius 0.80; plug recess radius 1.0 | construction choices, not hardware facts |
| V4 | joystick sensitivity 10 degrees tilt, 0.30 press, pivot z=0 and 3; XY placement sensitivity 0.10; cap travel sampling 9 positions; insertion sampling 1 mm | diagnostic scenarios only; J7/J9 remain unmeasured |

## R5 user feedback and original choices

Austin reports from the first physical print: joystick must be installed on
the board before the lid and retained by a lower lip; upper control should
be shaft and ball. Also requests a pry notch because the case is hard to
open. No new hardware dimensions supplied. Existing J rows still apply.

| ID | Choices in mm unless stated | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D5-JOY | shaft Ø4.20; retaining flange Ø10.40, bottom z=5.00, thickness 0.80; ball Ø7.00, centre z=11.40; throat Ø8.80; flange pocket Ø13.00, ceiling z=6.80; collar outside Ø15.80, roof 1.20 | ball passes opening from inside while wider lip is retained; raised collar clears lip's assumed tilt; socket and engagement inherited from R4 |
| D5-PRY | two side notches centred at y=L1/2, width 6.0 along y, height 1.60, depth 1.0 from exterior, radius 0.50; z centre=-TONGUE_H | gives tool access across skirt/base seam; retains 1.20 of wall behind notch, away from boards |
| V5 | sample press 0 and 0.30, pivots 0 and 3, tilt 0/5/10 degrees; cap pull-up 1.05; assembly clearance with vertical swept envelopes; tool tip 4.0 × 0.60, depth 0.70 | test scenarios, not measured joystick specs or opening-force guarantees |

### V2 print candidate / R5 completed choices

### V3 review choices — 2026-09-25

### V3 low-lid experiment — D7, 2026-09-25

### J1 isolated round-lip test — 2026-09-25

### V3-FIT fitted shell — 2026-09-25

### J2 stepped socket trial — 2026-09-25

| ID | Value | Source / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| J2-COLLAR-H | less than1 mm | Austin's direct report after asking collar-only height; not PCB-to-collar height |
| J2-SOCKET | Ø3.00 round opening depth1.00, then2.01 square depth2.00; total3.00 from cap underside | Austin's explicit trial dimensions; square width inherited J1. No extra clearance. IMG_0823 shows3.32 mm on caliper but feature unconfirmed; fit not guaranteed |
| J2-OUTER | identical J1 exterior; blind roof becomes localz3.00 instead of1.90; possible1.10 deeper seating if collar/body allow | Original derived geometry, not measured achievable travel. Do not lower lid until fitted; print flange-down as J1 |

### V3-FLAT parameters

| ID | Choice | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| V3-FLAT | uniform outer facez5.1; underside joystick roof4.4 unchanged; face-down print, rotate180degrees aroundX then translate bedz0; no supports/raft | Austin explicitly approves whole-face raise to fix print orientation. Existing J1 clearance, not new hardware measurement. Screen depth3.05 mm accepted provisionally; unchanged V2 button protrusion1.3 mm, .92 at full press |

### V3-FIT parameters (historical upright print)

| ID | Original design choice | Basis / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| V3-FIT-LID | screen side rails z3.05, local joystick roof4.4..5.1, holeØ8, pocketØ13, outer local bossØ15.8 clipped at screen window; inner pocket clipped window+.4, continuous .4 front wall; button-end top4.6, region ends pocketYmax+.8 | Retain J1's hand-held tested hole/height and V2 buttons; no universal lid-height raise. Local joystick front wall meets upper screen edge, so that small edge segment is higher than side rails. Boss shell dimensions inherited D5/D6; upright print to avoid floating skirt under face-down boss |
| V3-FIT-BUTTON | existing flange z2.61..3.41, pocket ceiling3.56, tops6.4, original4.2×5.4 posts | Exact V2 printed cap parameters; no new caps. V3 low D7 side-wing caps were never printed and must NOT be used |
| V3-FIT-PADS | extend original1.6 square corner pads outward to inner walls, top2.36, bottom.05 | Join pads to shell from first printed pad layer; small corner overhangs still require slicer review |
| V3-FIT-PRINT | both shells upright, bedz0, separation5; PLA .16,3 walls, no supports/raft | Original print plan; actual slice must be checked before start. Lid bottom skirt supplies bed contact, not the raised joystick face |
| V3-FIT-CHECK | inherited0/5/10degree, pivots0/3, press0/.3,8directions; lid-install lifts0..12 in .5 increments; seating shifts0/-.3; mesh tolerance.02/angular.1 | Hypotheses not hardware measurements; compare against J1 to prevent hiding new interference. Additional guessed-body contact reported separately |

### J1 isolated round-lip test parameters

| J1-CAP | socket 2.01 square, roof5.30, neck Ø5, bottom3.40; flange Ø10.4 × .4 at3.40; ball Ø7 centre8.5 | Original D6-SOCKET baseline; flange and shorter ball are original trial choices, not measurements |
| J1-LID | round hole Ø8, outer disk Ø20, underside4.4, thickness.7; two feet x=±9, width2, y length6, PCB contactz0 | Original hand-held test gauge, not production lid. Local top5.1 =3.05 above glass; surrounding production lid remains undecided. Feet establish height on bare PCB beside joystick; fit needs checking |

### D8 rear-tab experiment (historical, rejected)

Original follow-up after side tabs failed10-degree tilt. No hardware values changed.

| ID | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| D8-JOY | single rear arm, width2.4, y/z relative profile [(1.8,8.7),(2.7,8.7),(6.3,5.1),(6.3,2.5),(7.8,1.0),(7.8,.7),(7.0,.7),(7.0,1.3),(6.0,2.1),(5.8,2.1),(5.8,4.8),(1.8,8.5)] | reaches behind PCB edge so low tab can tilt below PCB plane without entering board; original socket/neck unchanged |
| D8-POCKET | opening x±6.4, y-6.1..+6.9, R.8; rear pocket x±2.5,y+5.5..+8.3, z-1.5..2.6 | clears rear arm and tab motion, retains tab in lid; extends into base inner end wall, leaves outer wall intact |

D8 clearance refinement: opening rear edge+7.4 (centre+.65, length13.5),
pocket ceiling2.45. Upper heel ramp passes (6.3,2.5),(7.3,1.0),(7.8,1.0);
lower return passes (7.8,.7),(7.0,.7),(7.0,1.15),(6.6,1.7),(6.0,2.1).
Adds clearance at the one full-tilt/press PCB contact found in the earlier
trial. Heel capture tested at1.5 mm upward travel. Thin arm/heel junction
must be inspected in slicing; strength is not established.

V8 retains ALL 0/5/10-degree lid checks as required, adds base/PCB and
rear-arm/fixed-hardware checks at all sampled poses; only inherited neck
versus guessed body intersections remain diagnostic. Screen depth <=1 mm
is a required assertion. Current cap retention pull-up check is1.5 mm.

User requires lid no more than1 mm above glass. Previous uniform raise is
rejected. These are original design trials, NOT new hardware measurements.

| ID | Choice | Reason / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| D7-LID | top=S3+1.0=3.05; plate above glass-clearance plane .70 | screen-depth hard limit; no boss |
| D7-JOY | retain previous socket/neck/ball; two side arms, y thickness2.4; right x/z polygon relative to stem [(1.8,8.7),(2.7,8.7),(7.1,4.3),(7.1,1.1),(6.3,1.1),(6.3,4.0),(1.8,8.5)], mirror left; lip tabs x6.3..8.3, y±1.2, z1.1..1.5 | bypass guessed metal body; upper arms expand gradually in inverted printing; test motion, not assumed adequate |
| D7-POCKET | joystick opening15.4×12.2, R.8; underside tab pockets span x±8.8, y±2, ceiling2.4 | ball and upper arms pass opening; side tabs retained; front edge .43 from screen window |
| D7-BUTTON | flange bottom1.8, thickness.4; plunger contact roof2.61; underside switch relief width B2+.5, depth B1+.5; footprint and protrusion inherited | hidden side wings pass beside switch, rather than flange above plunger; flat top printing planned |
| V7 | required trial5-degree tilt, .3 press, pivots0/3; retain10-degree scenarios as diagnostics; cap upward .95 | actual joystick travel is unmeasured; larger-angle clearance must not be falsely claimed |

Austin reports V2 USB alignment good but rejects the tall lid fin/tab and
gaps. Requests V1-style closed port, earlier joystick interface plus V2 ball,
internal retaining lip, flat support-free lid. Uniform extra case height is
allowed if needed; buttons must maintain protrusion. Browser approval before
printing. No new physical measurement supplied.

| ID | Choice | Source / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| D6-SOCKET | square2.01, roof z5.30, bottom z3.40, neck Ø5 | repository's original full-case test2 commit4010773; both earlier submitted caps used2.01 square and roof5.30, but first lid-only cap had bottom4.00 and neck7.8. Exact physical V1 cap source still unconfirmed; select full-case baseline explicitly, not a proven identification |
| D6-JOY | ball Ø7, centre11.4 retained; flatten top .8 for inverted bed contact; flange Ø10.4, bottom5.0, thickness.6; upper flange 45-degree taper from radius5.2 at5.6 to radius2.5 at8.3 | original support-avoiding construction; lower socket unchanged from selected earlier CAD |
| D6-LID | whole flat lid top8.6; joystick pocket Ø13, ceiling7.4; throat Ø9.6; roof1.2; buttons protrude1.8; screen-side pocket wall .4 | uniform lid4.0 higher than V1/V2 flat face, no local boss; clipped pocket keeps a thin wall to screen; inspect wall in slicing |
| D6-USB | closed rectangular base port at V2 bounds, existing cable recess, no lid fin | user reports alignment works; restores closed-port topology, assembly now USB-first rather than straight drop of connected stack |
| V6 | cap pull-up1.55; tilt scenarios inherited; USB-first separate Pico path: rotate0 to -12 degrees around shell-front centre, retreat1.8 in y, lift30; steps2degrees/.3mm/selected lift heights; full lid bed area >300 square mm; flat top tolerance .001 | diagnostics not physical validation; actual USB-first assembly and support-free slicing require review |

Austin authorizes scan-based estimates and iteration (2026-09-24).

| ID | Value | Source / rationale |
|---|---|---|
| PINK-BTN-SCAN | component-face button centre offsets: lateral v=-3.2868, USB-ward u=13.4370 mm from PCB centre; detected light pad bbox 51×70 pixels | scan01 at 23.665753 px/mm; tools/measure_scan.py pink board fit; plunger centroid crop-local (294.0667,409.7847), full scan (1294.0667,859.7847). Scan is readable, not itself mirrored. Component face is opposite LCD front, so installed CAD x=-v, y=u. Registration remains a fit-test estimate. |
| D5-ACCESS | hole Ø4.0; button proxy Ø2.4, height 1.8 below component face | hole around scan pad, tool clearance; proxy height is a GUESS, not measured; no reset-function claim |
| D5-BUTTON | post x=4.2, y=5.4; flange x=4.85, y=6.3; proud=1.8; clearances/radii inherited | widen perpendicular to button row, avoid neighbour collision; reduce row-axis lip from .4 to .325; rectangular post cannot enter turned 90 degrees |
| D5-USB | selected shell stand-off=2.41 (A1_USB-A1_PCB); clearance .35 each side; outer cable recess height6.0, width12.5 unchanged | V1 photo shows socket above hole; choose higher of conflicting recorded placements, not a fabricated caliper update. Centre .42 higher than R4, .84 higher than P15-only model; shell aperture now 9.57×3.71. P15 still governs conservative floor depth. Actual cable fit needs print test. |
### J3 / L1 lowered flat trial — 2026-09-25

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J3-SOCKET | Round diameter 3.50, depth 1.10; square 2.01 wide, next 2.00 deep | Austin's explicit J2 fit feedback; square retained from J2 |
| J3-LIP | Lip top approximately S3 + 0.40 | Austin's visual estimate, own IMG_0828; not calibrated |
| L1-FACE | Outer face z4.20; joystick underside z3.50 | Original trial choice: 0.90 lower than V3 flat; 0.70 joystick roof; 0.64 roof over retained button pockets |
| L1-KEEP | Base, snaps, holes and button pockets unchanged; joystick outside unchanged | Original design choice, isolate height and socket changes |
| L1-PLATE | 5 mm separation between print parts | Original plate layout choice |
### L2 roof translation — 2026-09-25

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| L2-DROP | 1.00 mm below L1, entire roof thickness retained | Austin explicit fit-trial instruction, supersedes 1.50 mm request |
| L2-JOIN | Preserve original lower geometry through S3 + GLASS_CLEAR; translate upper geometry down, union | Original construction choice preserves base mating and PCB contacts, shortens walls |
| L2-RESULT | Face z3.20, joystick underside z2.50, button underside z2.56 | Derived from L1 minus L2-DROP; roofs remain 0.70 and 0.64 mm |
| L2-CAP | Exact J2, circle 3.00 × 1.00 then square 2.01 × 2.00 | Austin selects prior joystick unchanged |
### L3 alignment — 2026-09-25

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| L3-HOLE | Shift opening 1.00 mm toward LCD (CAD Y minus 1.00); diameter remains 8.00 | Austin's physical fit instruction and own IMG_0831/0830/0829; direction confirmed, amount chosen from his request |
| L3-KEEP | Restore L1 face z4.20, joystick underside z3.50; keep original pocket, button geometry and mating skirt | Austin requests previous height and hole-only correction; original construction choice leaves lip pocket unchanged |
### L4 halfway-back correction

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| L4-OFFSET | From original centre: X +0.30, Y -0.50 mm | Austin requests halfway back from L3 and slightly photo-up; +0.30 trial choice. Photo LCD-right maps up to positive CAD X |
| L4-KEEP | L1 height, 8 mm aperture, existing pocket/skirt/buttons | User hole-only refinement; retain L3 non-aperture geometry |
### S1 lower-seam strong shell — original design choices

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| S1-SPLIT | Z_BOTTOM + (L1.TOP - Z_BOTTOM)/3 = -12.36 | Austin requests visible top 2/3, base 1/3; existing total shell height retained |
| S1-WALL | 3.00 mm, extra 0.80 outward per side; outer radius 3.80 | Original strengthening choice; preserves internal board clearance |
| S1-JOINT | Overlap 3.00, socket wall 1.40, radial gap 0.20, axial gap 0.20, male wall 1.40 mm | Original hidden overlapping joint; no exterior flex slots |
| S1-SNAP | Four ramped bumps, width 6.00, height 1.20, radial projection 0.35; centre seam+1.50 | Original trial internal detents; 0.15 nominal flex after mating clearance, not strength-tested |
| S1-RECESS | Blind recess depth 0.35, end clearance 0.30, height clearance 0.15 | Original hidden catch pockets; minimum outer skin 1.05 mm |
| S1-SUPPORT | Side support rails floor to LCD-back, 0.25 gap from upper inner walls | Original base-carried rails replace old wall-supported shelves, retain PCB height and permit lid installation |
| S1-PRY | One left long-side notch at seam, 6 wide, 1.6 high, 1 deep | Austin requests one opening notch; prior notch dimensions reused |
| S1-FACE | L4/L1 z4.20, all control pockets unchanged; extend solid perimeter outward | Preserve fitted roof/controls; strengthen with continuous 3mm perimeter/deep walls, no local boss |
| S1-PLATE | 5 mm minimum layout gap; 7 parts, no scaling | Original plate arrangement for approved S1 full-set print |
### S2 base retention / tactile buttons — original trial choices

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| S2-FEEDBACK | About 0.25 mm visible base drop; opens too easily; buttons indistinct | Austin's physical observation, approximate, not caliper reading |
| S2-CATCH | Projection 0.50 vs S1 0.35; underside 0.04 above existing pocket bottom; vertical nose 0.30; ramp to original bump top | Original trial to reduce axial slack and improve holding; nominal socket flex 0.30, pocket radial spare 0.05 mm |
| S2-BUTTON | Top z6.90 vs6.40, top-edge rounding radius1.20; unchanged4.2×5.4 post and4.85×6.3 flange | Original trial tactile profile, +0.50 mm height, narrower top contact surface |
| S2-KEEP | Same S1 lid, shell body, rails, USB/reset/pry, J2 joystick, button centres/flanges/contact planes | Minimize reprints; no hardware datum changes |
| S2-PLATE | 5mm spacing; base plus four buttons, floor/flanges down | Original plate arrangement; PLA0.16,4walls, no supports/raft |
### V1.0 production nudges — Austin's final physical test of S2

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1-FEEDBACK | S2 base + S2 buttons on S1 lid with J2: "This works." Snap and buttons accepted | Austin, 2026-09-25, hands-on test of printed parts |
| V1-NUDGE | 0.25 mm per nudge | Austin's estimate ("just a hair ... quarter millimeter"), not a caliper reading |
| V1-JOY | Joystick throat +0.25 y (toward USB-C end, away from LCD); x unchanged. Centre now (13.4671, 45.8792) | Austin's feedback + photo IMG_0848 (direction only, no dimension taken) |
| V1-USB | USB-C aperture and outer plug recess +0.25 z (toward lid); size unchanged. Aperture z -18.00 to -14.22 | Austin's feedback + photo IMG_0844: receptacle touches top edge. Bottom clearance to modelled shell drops 0.35 → 0.10 |
| V1-RESET | Base reset hole -0.25 y (away from USB-C end, toward centre). Centre now (16.5068, 39.4370) | Austin's feedback |
| V1-PLATE | 5 mm gap; 7 parts: lid face down, base floor down, J2 + four S2 caps flange down | Same arrangement as S1-PLATE |
### V1.1 USB-end spacer — Austin's PETG v1.0 test

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.1-FEEDBACK | The board stack slides along the case. It lines up best pushed fully toward the buttons, with about 1.2 mm of play ("more than a millimeter") | Austin, 2026-09-25, hands-on test of the PETG v1.0 print; estimate, not a caliper reading. The CAD model shows only 0.6 mm of play (2 × CLEAR); his reading is used |
| V1.1-SPACER | Stop face 1.0 mm in from the USB-end inner wall (y 52.80 → 51.80) | His 1.2 mm, minus 0.2 mm left free so the rigid PCB cannot jam |
| V1.1-LIP | Lid lip between the rails, x 2.76–23.68, z -1.97 to 0 at the face, 45° chamfer to z 1.0 at the wall | Original; catches the LCD PCB edge, and the chamfer prints face-down with no support |
| V1.1-STOP | Base rail end stops, y 51.80–52.55, z -1.97 to -0.30 | Original; locates the board before the lid goes on, stays under the PCB front face |
### V1.2 half spacer

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.2-FEEDBACK | The v1.1 spacer is in the right place but too big: the screen board no longer fits flush | Austin, 2026-09-25, v1.1 white PETG lid on the v1.0 base |
| V1.2-SPACER | 0.5 mm (half of v1.1); stop face at y 52.30; lip chamfer 0.5 | Austin: "let's try a half a millimeter" |
### V1.3 short USB end — replaces the V1.1/V1.2 spacers

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.3-SHORTEN | USB-C end wall moved 0.5 mm inward on lid and base (outer face 55.80 → 55.30, inner face 52.80 → 52.30); case 59.10 → 58.60 long. No lip, no spacer | Austin, 2026-09-25: "Take the wall in. A half millimeter. Get rid of the lip." Amount from the v1.1 test (1.0 mm too much) |
| V1.3-L1-RECHECK | LCD hat length 52.46 (caliper, Austin, 2026-09-25, no photo). The model uses L1 = 52.50 | The 0.04 mm difference is ignored. v1.3 design inside length is 52.60 (v1.0: 53.10), leaving 0.14 mm on the design |
### V1.4 rounded edges — look trial

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.4-FEEDBACK | Round the edges around the LCD and around the top so it looks better | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| V1.4-TOP-R | 1.5 mm fillet on the lid's top outer perimeter | Original choice; under the 3.8 vertical corner radius |
| V1.4-WINDOW-R | 0.7 mm fillet on the LCD window's top edge | Original choice; under the 0.8 window corner radius |
| V1.4-R-REV3 | Top perimeter 3.0 mm (= wall thickness), LCD window 1.2 mm. They replace the 1.5 and 0.7 above | Austin: "round it a little bit more ... more rounded". A larger window radius fails, because the window step is only 0.7 mm tall |
| V1.4-WINDOW-IN | LCD window 1.0 mm smaller on every side: it was 0.4 mm past the glass edge and now covers 0.6 mm of the glass border | Austin: "the screen has some black, so we can encroach a little bit ... all the way around". The amount is an original choice; the border width is not measured |
| V1.4-GLASS-GAP | The bezel ring reaches down to 0.3 mm above the glass top (S3) | Original; gives the 1.2 mm rounding enough depth and cuts parallax at an angle |
### J4 flat-top joystick (v1.4)

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J4-FEEDBACK | The fully round ball makes the joystick's press-in click hard to hit. Keep a ball, flat on top | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| J4-FLAT | 5.0 mm flat pad cut from the J2 7.0 mm ball, 1.05 mm below the old top. Ball centre, neck, flange and socket unchanged | Original choice |
| J4-RIM | 0.6 mm fillet around the pad | Original choice, for comfort |
| J4-WAIST | The ball is cut where it has narrowed to 5.5 mm (J4 review 2; replaces J4-FLAT) | Austin: "a little hat ... comes to a top, then comes back out, then goes flat" |
| J4-HAT | A 45° flare from 5.5 to 7.0 mm, then a 0.6 mm disc edge; the top is 12.02, the same height as J2 (12.00) | Original. 45° prints flange-down with no support; 7.0 mm = ball width, under the 8 mm lid hole |
| J4-RIM-2 | 0.5 mm top edge; flat pad about 6 mm (was about 3.8) | Austin: "make it a little bigger" |
| J4-BALL | Ball 7.4 mm (J2: 7.0), cut flat through its centre: a half ball with a flat top all the way across. 0.3 mm rim edge break. The top is 3.7 mm below J2's | Austin: "make the ball a little bit bigger ... just barely fits through the hole ... at the widest part make it flat all the way across". Largest size without new lid contact in the J1-CHECK tilt scenarios: 7.6 and 7.5 graze the 8 mm hole at 10°/pivot z0; 7.4 leaves 0.3 mm each side |
### J5 — press-in room (v1.4 joystick)

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J5-FEEDBACK | With the cap off, the stick's press-in click works. With the cap on it barely moves; up/down/left/right are fine. Make the socket narrow sooner so the cap rides higher | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| J5-LIFT | Round mouth 1.0 → 0.7 mm (cap rides 0.3 higher); square 2.0 unchanged. The outside is identical to J4 | Original choice; press travel J9 still not measured |
| J5-VARIANTS | Test pair: lift 0.3 and 0.5 | In the J1-CHECK tilt scenarios the flange rim meets the roof underside at the hole: 0.5 is clear to ~6°, 0.3 to ~9°, 0.2 to 10°. The pair trades press room against tilt room |
### J6 — clean centre press test set

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J6-FEEDBACK | With the cap on, pressing in gives centre plus up, right or left; the bare stem gives a clean centre. Neither J5 variant fixed it. "Maybe it needs to be tighter" | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| J6-A | Square socket 1.95 (J2 2.01) on the 1.86 stem; flat top; 1 notch | Original trial: less rocking on the stem |
| J6-B | Square socket 1.90; flat top; 2 notches | Original trial; may press-fit once PETG prints undersize |
| J6-C | Square socket 1.95 plus a 0.4 deep, 5.0 mm thumb dish; 3 notches | Original trial: centres the push, less leverage off-axis |
| J6-KEEP | J5 lift 0.3, round mouth 0.7, square depth 2.0, 7.4 half ball | Unchanged from J5 |
| J6-NOTCH | 0.6 wide × 0.5 deep flange rim notches; the flange stays ≥ 9.4 > 8 mm hole | Original, for identification |
### J7 — printable socket

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J7-FEEDBACK | The J6 socket was full of PETG strings (IMG_0887) | Austin, 2026-09-26; cause: flat ledge and flat roof over air when printed flange down |
| J7-SOCKET | Round Ø3.0 for 0.7 (clears the 2.94 lip, J4b), a round-to-square loft funnel (flats at 45°), square grip to z +2.7, then a 45° pyramid roof. The straight grip is 1.475 long (was 2.0) | Original. Uses J4 (1.86 stem) and J4b (2.94 lip); the stem is wider at its base (J5), so the top of the grip carries it |
| J7-VARIANTS | A 1.95 / B 1.90 / C 1.95 with dish; notches 1/2/3; the outside is identical to J6 | As J6 |
### J8 — variations on J7-B

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J8-FEEDBACK | B (1.90) fits best but a direction push sometimes also clicks the centre; A is worse; B's confirm print "not it" was a single-copy check | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| J8-1 | B + flange 10.4 → 9.2 (1 notch) | Original: less rim dip when tilted |
| J8-2 | B + flange 9.2 + lift 0.5 (2 notches) | Original: more room under the rim; may catch the lid at full tilt (J5-VARIANTS) |
| J8-3 | B + top rim edge 0.3 → 1.2 (3 notches) | Original: the thumb rolls off sideways rather than pressing down |
| J8-KEEP | J7 printable socket 1.90, 7.4 flat-top half ball | Unchanged |
| J9 | J8-3 without notches: J7-B's 1.90 printable socket (void identical, checked), 10.4 flange, lift 0.3, 1.2 round top edge | Austin, 2026-09-26: "b has the best hole, three has the best surface". J8-3 clicked centre + up every time despite an identical socket; three copies test for print variation |
### J10 — flange that cannot lift into the lid

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J10-FEEDBACK | On some devices a direction push clicks twice: once for the direction, then a little farther the centre too. The flange edge behind the push rises into the lid underside, pivots there and drives the stem down | Austin, 2026-09-29: "I can hear it click once, and then if I push a little farther, I can hear it click in" |
| J10-TAB | Four tabs replace the 10.4 disc: 1.6 wide, tips at radius 4.6 (0.6 past the 8 mm hole edge, as J8-1's 9.2 flange), 0.4 thick as the disc | Original. A tab off the push axis rises less than the disc rim behind the push |
| J10-I / II | I: tabs on the diagonals of the socket square. II: tabs in line with the socket flats | Original. Which way the stem square is turned on the board is not measured, so the pair covers both; the one that works also tells us |
| J10-LOWER | III: J9 disc, IV: tabs as I, both riding 0.2 lower (lift 0.3 → 0.1) | Original. More room under the lid, but J5 raised the cap for press room, so the press may get stiff |
| J10-MARK | Roman numeral I–IV engraved on the flat top: grooves 0.6 wide, 0.4 deep, 2.6 tall | Austin, 2026-09-29: "write the number on the top of each one ... like Roman numerals" |
| J10-KEEP | J9 socket (1.90 printable, void identical for I/II, checked), 7.4 flat-top half ball, 1.2 round top edge | Unchanged |
| J10-TILT | Model tilt before any lid contact (cad/j10_tilt.py, v1.7 lid, cap centred in the hole). Pivot 3: J9 14.2°, I 16.2–17.4°, II 16.2–17.1°, III/IV 15.5–16.1°. Pivot 0: the neck meets the hole wall first, sideways (no push down), at 11.5° (J9, I, II) and 10.4° (III, IV) | Comparison only: the true tilt (J7) and seating height (J3-LIP) are not measured, and the real part clicks before these angles |

### J11 — square flange, corners on the diagonals

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J11-FEEDBACK | J10's caps fall through the lid hole and don't stay on the stick; the tabs are "stupid". Keep the cap that sat on the stick and make the flange a square: thin toward up/down/left/right, corners toward NE/NW/SE/SW, smaller than the round pad but bigger than the hole | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J11-SQUARE | Flange square 8.0 (I, II) or 7.2 (III, IV) across the flats, 0.4 thick as J9; corners clipped to an 11.0 circle (only the 8.0 square reaches it). Corners 1.1–1.5 past the 8 mm hole edge | Original. The flats set how far the edge behind a push rises: 4.0 or 3.6 × sin(tilt), against J9's 5.2 |
| J11-ORIENT | I/III: square in line with the socket square. II/IV: turned 45° | The stem square's turn on the board is not measured; the pair whose flats face up/down/left/right on the device is the right one |
| J11-KEEP | Everything else is J9: socket void identical (checked), ride height, 7.4 half ball, 1.2 top edge; numerals engraved as J10-MARK | Unchanged |
| J11-TILT | Model, pivot 3, push along the board axes: J9 14.2°, I and III 17.1–17.4°, II 13.4°, IV 14.6° (II and IV are the right ones only if the stem is turned 45°). Pivot 0: the neck meets the hole wall at 11.5° for all | cad/joystick_j11.py via j10_tilt.tilt; comparison only |
| J11-DROP | Not built: a flange that drops lower outside the switch body (Austin's idea). It needs the body height above the PCB (J3, never measured; the model's 3.0 is a render guess) and would put the corners, not the flat underside, on the bed | Open |

### J12 — J11-III riding higher

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J12-FEEDBACK | J11-III: up/down/left/right no longer click the centre. The centre press is hard to get without a direction; the cap sits too low, so make the hole for the stick less deep, four versions of III | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J12-LIFT | Lift 0.4 / 0.5 / 0.6 / 0.7 (V / VI / VII / VIII): the round mouth is 0.6 / 0.5 / 0.4 / 0.3 deep, so the cap rides 0.1–0.4 higher than III. Square grip, funnel and roof unchanged, moved down in the cap | J5-LIFT method; values are Austin's "different depths", spaced 0.1 |
| J12-KEEP | J11-III flange (7.2 square, in line with the socket), J9 ball and top edge | Unchanged (checked) |
| J12-MARK | Numerals V–VIII, continuing J11's I–IV; strokes 0.5 wide, 2.2 tall, 0.4 deep so VIII fits inside the 5 mm flat | Austin, 2026-09-29 (numbers on top) |
| J12-TILT | Model, pivot 3, push along the board axes: III 17.1°, V 18.0°, VI 17.6°, VII 15.8°, VIII 14.1° (J9 14.2°, which double-clicked). Diagonal pushes: 14.6 → 13.4 / 12.2 / 11.0 / 9.8 | Riding higher brings the flange toward the lid; VIII gives back the room J11 gained. Comparison only |

### J13 — ride height and flange top, square and round

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J13-FEEDBACK | VI: directions clean, centre press doesn't quite click. VII: centre clicks every time, some directions click it too. The answer is between VI and VII. Letters, not Roman numerals (they printed as "weird holes"). Also try round: through the hole you can see past the square's flats into the case | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J13-LIFT | H 0.55; T 0.60; L 0.65; X 0.70; O and E 0.60 | Between/above VI (0.5) and VII (0.6) |
| J13-THIN | T, L, X, O, E: flange 0.24 thick from the hole edge (r 4) out, full 0.4 inside r 3.4, 11° taper between. The underside stays flat on the bed | Original. Lowers the flange top 0.16 where the lid can reach it, without moving the underside that sets press room |
| J13-ROUND | O: 8.6 disc (0.3 past the hole); E: 8.8 disc (0.4 past) | Original. Model at VII height: 8.6 19.7°, 8.8 14.9°, 9.0 14.6° (VII 15.8°). O may be loose in the hole |
| J13-MARK | One bold letter per cap: strokes 0.9 wide, 3.2 × 2.6, 0.5 deep | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J13-TILT | Model, pivot 3, board-axis push: VI 17.6°, VII 15.8°; H 16.7°, T 18.5°, L 17.6°, X 16.7°, O 19.7°, E 14.9° | cad/joystick_j13.py; comparison only |

### J14 — J13-O in three stick fits

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J14-FEEDBACK | J13-O is the best of J13 (rough print). Print clean copies, one step tighter and one step looser on the stick, named one, two, three | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J14-FIT | Square grip 1.85 (1) / 1.90 (2, = O) / 1.95 (3); stem 1.86 (J4) | Step 0.05 as J6/J7. 1 is 0.01 under the stem: a press fit before print shrink |
| J14-KEEP | J13-O outside unchanged: 8.6 disc thinned under the lid, lift 0.6 (checked, so lid clearance equals O) | Unchanged |
| J14-MARK | 1–3 engraved dots on top, Ø1.0 × 0.5 deep, 1.5 apart | Replaces letters, which printed messy |

### J15 — production joystick

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J15 | J14-2 with the dots filled: plain flat top. Everything else identical (checked) | Austin, 2026-09-30: "we kinda just want it to be flat on top" |

### J16 — square-only socket, diagonal flares

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J16-FEEDBACK | After 12 J15: pushed hard, the cap's round mouth slides down over the stem's thick base and the centre press stops working; pulled hard, the cap comes out through the lid. Want a square hole all the way down, and NE/NW/SE/SW flares on the round flange | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J16-SOCKET | 1.90 square from the bed face to J15's roof (same ride height); 0.25 × 45° mouth chamfer (2.40 < the 2.94 lip, J4b) against elephant foot | Original. The 2.94 lip can no longer enter; it stops the cap |
| J16-FLARE | Four flares on the socket diagonals: 1.2 wide, rounded tips at r 4.8 (0.8 past the hole; the disc is 0.3), 0.24 thick past the hole edge like the disc | Original. Model lid room at VII height 17.6° = VI (tested clean). 2.4-wide full-thickness flares gave 12.3°, 1.4×5.2×0.32 gave 14.8° |
| J16-KEEP | J15 otherwise: 8.6 disc thinned under the lid, lift 0.6 roof, flat top (checked) | Unchanged |

### J17 — J16 gradient A–E: bigger tabs, shallower hole

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J17-FEEDBACK | J16 does not double-click, but the hole should be shallower and the tabs 2–3× bigger. Start from J16 with bigger tabs (A), go to where the model is sure it double-clicks (E), gradient between | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J17-STEP | Hole shallower 0 / 0.05 / 0.10 / 0.15 / 0.20 (A–E); tab scale 1.3 / 1.55 / 1.8 / 2.05 / 2.3 × J16's (width 1.56–2.76, tip r 4.95–5.45); 0.24 thick past the hole edge | Original gradient. At 2–3× tabs the model puts every cap below VII |
| J17-TILT | Model, pivot 3, push: J16 17.6°, A 16.6°, B 15.1°, C 13.7°, D 12.5°, E 11.4° (VI 17.6° clean, VII 15.8° double-clicked) | cad/joystick_j17.py; comparison only |
| J17-MARK | Dice dots on top: A 1 … E 5, Ø0.9 × 0.5 deep | As J14 dots, which printed clean |

### J18 — hole depth sweep

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J18-FEEDBACK | Pressing a J16/J17 cap clicks all five switches; the bare stick clicks only the centre. The hole isn't shallow enough | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J4c | Stick tip to the top of the wider collar at its base: about 2 mm | Austin's estimate, 2026-09-30 ("about 2 millimeters, I think"); not a caliper reading |
| J18-DEPTH | Cap bottom to the square's flat roof: 2.2 / 2.1 / 2.0 / 1.9 / 1.8 / 1.7 (dice dots 1–6); J16/J17-A 2.4 | Austin's values, bracketing J4c |
| J18-TAB | J17-B tabs (1.55× J16: 1.86 wide, tip r 5.08) on all six | Austin: "the flange you had on the two dot" |
| J18-TILT | If the stick tip sits on the roof, a shallower hole rides higher. Model, pivot 3, push: J17-B 15.1°, 1 12.5°, 2 11.0°, 3 9.6°, 4 8.3°, 5 6.9°, 6 5.5° (VI 17.6° clean, VII 15.8° double-click) | cad/joystick_j18.py; comparison only |

### J19 — shallower still

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J19-FEEDBACK | Even J18-6 (1.7) presses all five switches | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J19-DEPTH | Hole 1.6 / 1.5 / 1.4 / 1.3 / 1.2 (dice dots 1–5), J17-B tabs. 1.2 leaves 0.95 of straight grip | Austin's values |
| J19-TILT | Model, if the stick tip seats on the roof: 4.2° / 2.8° / 1.5° / 0.1° / touching at rest. Austin's J18 result (1.7 still reaches the collar) suggests the tip doesn't seat on the roof, so the model's ride height is likely wrong here | Comparison only |

### J20 — 1.5 deep with a wide mouth

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J20-FEEDBACK | J19 "still not quite right". Take J19-2 (1.5 total depth) and make the first 0.5 a wide round opening that fits over the stick's base, as earlier caps had | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J20-MOUTH | Round Ø3.2 for 0.5 (0.13 per side over the 2.94 collar, J4b), then J7's 45° round-to-square funnel (0.65), 1.90 square to the flat roof at 1.5 (0.35 straight), pyramid roof | Original sizes on Austin's depths. The funnel avoids a flat ledge over air |
| J20-KEEP | J19-2 outside the socket (J17-B tabs, 8.6 disc, thinned), flat top | Checked |

### J21 — wide mouth, deeper

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J21-FEEDBACK | J20's 1.5 "is not nearly deep enough": try 1.9 and 2.0 with the same wide opening | Austin, 2026-09-30 |
| J21-DEPTH | 1.9 (1 dot), 2.0 (2 dots); J20 mouth 3.2 × 0.5 + funnel; straight square 0.75 / 0.85 | Austin's values; J20 otherwise (checked) |

### J22 — production joystick

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J22 | J21-1 (wide 3.2 × 0.5 mouth + funnel, 1.9 deep, J17-B tabs) with the dot filled: plain flat top. Identical otherwise (checked) | Austin, 2026-09-30: "Number one was the one ... smooth out the top" |

### J20-JM — looser grip for Jason's printer

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| J20JM-FEEDBACK | On Jason's printer the J19 plate (1.90 grip) will not start over the stick in any rotation | Jason, 2026-09-30, after printing `joystick-j19-plate.stl` (printer and settings not recorded) |
| J4-JM | Stem across the flats: 1.8 | Jason's caliper, 2026-09-30; no photo saved. Agrees with J4 (1.86, cal) within reading |
| J20JM-GRIP | Square grip 2.00 / 2.05 / 2.10 / 2.15 / 2.20 (dice dots 1–5), step 0.05 as J6/J7/J14 | Original. 1.90 printed under 1.8 on Jason's printer, so start above J14-3 (1.95, Austin's loosest); 2.20 + 2 × 0.25 chamfer = 2.70 < 2.94 lip (J4b) |
| J20JM-KEEP | Depth 1.6 (J19-1), J17-B tabs, J16 mouth chamfer; at 1.90 the J20-JM code reproduces J19-1 exactly (checked) | Jason: change the grip only |

### V1.4 lid crush ribs

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.4-RIB-FEEDBACK | Lid and base should hold together a little better. The bases are already printed, so change the lid only | Austin, 2026-09-26; he chose Claude's crush-rib option and said "take our best guess" |
| V1.4-RIB | 12 vertical ribs on the lid socket's inner wall (4 per long side at y 3.5/20/32.5/48, 2 per end at x 6/20); 0.6 wide; reach 0.35 from the wall = 0.15 into the tongue past the 0.2 gap; 1.0 mm lead-in at the seam; z seam to seam + 2.8 | Original best guess. Clear of the catches and the pry notch; physical fit untested |
### V1.5 taller lid

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.5-FEEDBACK | With J9, direction pushes also click the centre, but only with the lid on; with the lid off the stick is clean. "Make the lid just a little taller so there is more room for the joystick" | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| V1.5-RAISE | 0.5 mm | Original; the case is 25.34 tall (was 24.84) |
| V1.5-STRETCH | Stretched at z 1.0 above the LCD PCB front, in the lid's prismatic band 0.2–1.2 (checked). The board hold-down below is unchanged | Original |
| V1.5-BUTTON | S2 caps with the flange 0.8 → 1.3 thick; the post is raised 0.5, so protrusion and retention match v1.4 | Original |
| V1.5-JOY-EDGE | Joystick hole top edge rounded 0.6; the raised edge grazed the J9 ball at 10°/pivot 0 | Original; J9 now clears the J1-CHECK tilts to 10° |
### V1.6 smooth top edge

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.6-FEEDBACK | A rough line on the v1.5 lid where the flat top meets the rounded edge. "No raft or anything I have to remove" | Austin, 2026-09-26 |
| V1.6-BEVEL | Material fills the 3 mm top fillet's flat start up to a 45° line tangent at its 45° point (0.88 in, 0.88 down); flat top → 45° band → curve. Nothing near the outer top edge overhangs >45° face-down (checked by sampling; v1.5 failed the same test) | Original. No supports or raft |
| V1.6-EFC | Slicer elephant-foot compensation 0.15 mm (print note) | Common slicer setting; removes the first-layer lip at that edge |
### V1.7 locking case

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.7-FEEDBACK | It opens too easily and buttons spill out. PETG may relax over time. It should never pop open by accident, can be opened on purpose, and must still close | Austin, 2026-09-27: "do all three" |
| V1.7-HOOK | Catch tip 0.5 past the skirt face (was 0.3); projection 0.7 from the tongue; lid pocket 0.55 deep, skin 0.85 | Original. The hold comes from the hook shape, not friction |
| V1.7-RAMP | Flat hold at the S2 height (0.04 play), 0.3 nose, ramp up to seam + 2.4: ~28° from vertical | Original; keeps closing easy |
| V1.7-ENDS | One more 6 mm catch centred on each short end (6 total); lid pockets to match | Original; clear of the ribs and USB |
| V1.7-PRY | The lid's half of the pry notch is filled; the base keeps its 6 × 0.8 × 1.0 slot | Original; open with a thumbnail or small tool |
| V1.7-NOTE | The v1.4–v1.6 lids' two button-end ribs sit at x 5.4/19.4, not 6/20 (a wedge_y winding bug, found in v1.7). Harmless, clear of all catches | Found 2026-09-27 |
| V1.7-HOLE-BEVEL | The LCD window edge (1.2 fillet) and joystick hole edge (0.6 fillet) get the same 45° tangent fill as V1.6-BEVEL; the openings are unchanged below the fill | Austin, 2026-09-27: a rough edge on the button side of the LCD opening (v1.5/v1.6 lid). The sampled check finds 50 steep spots on the v1.6 lid (13 on the button side) and 0 on v1.7 |

### SP — I2C wiring spacer between the Pico and the LCD

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SP-FEEDBACK | A thin printed part between the Pico and the LCD for 4 wires (3V3, GND, SDA, SCL) to an external OPTIGA Trust M I2C breakout; the cable leaves through the non-USB end. The wires are independent of the part (no pin routing); it sits between the boards with a strain-relief clip; the cable is a pigtail (one plug cut off, the plug stays outside) | Jason, 2026-10-01 |
| SP-PLATE | Plate on the Pico's LCD-facing face between the header strips: x = Pico centre ± 7.32 (strip inner edge P10/2 − HEADER_W/2 = 7.62, minus CLEAR 0.30); y from CLEAR 0.30 inside the end wall with the stack slid fully to the button end, to 4.30 past the inner wall face; 1.4 thick | Original. Strips are the provisional H1 envelope (PINK-STRIP pending) |
| SP-PEG | Two pegs in the button-end Pico holes: Ø1.8 = PICO-HOLES-PROV Ø2.1 − 2 × JOY_SOCKET_CLEAR 0.15; 1.63 long (PINK-P3 1.23 + 0.4); 0.3 × 45° tip chamfer | Original; positions and hole size from `cad/pico_holes.py` (provisional, PINK-P20 pending) |
| SP-WIRE | Wire envelope: up to Ø1.0 per wire | Original design envelope, not a cable measurement; check against Q-OD |
| SP-CLIP | Two clips at the button-end edge, 2 wires each: channel 2.2 wide (2 × 1.0 + MATE_CLEAR 0.20), 1.2 long, cut through the plate so the wires rest on the Pico face; its top 0.4 is a lip with a 0.85 mouth (SP-WIRE 1.0 − V1.4-RIB 0.15 interference): push one wire through, slide it aside, then the other; 0.4 wall to the plate edge, so centres at Pico centre ∓ 5.82 | Original |
| SP-PRINT | Prints top face down, pegs up, no supports | Original; no downward faces above the bed in that orientation (checked) |

### V1.8 non-USB end cable slots

| ID | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| V1.8-SLOT | Two slots through the base's non-USB end wall, in line with the SP clips: 2.5 wide (2 × 1.0 + 2 × CAP_HOLE_CLEAR 0.25) × 1.5 tall (1.0 + 2 × 0.25), from 0.25 below the Pico's LCD-facing face; roof 0.65 below the seam; 1.57 clear of the end catch on each side | Original. Base only, below the seam: no catch, rib or lid change, so the v1.7 lid still fits |
| V1.8-WHY-TWO | The wall below the seam has 1.9 above the Pico face, and the end catch is centred. Four wires flat beside the catch do not fit between the header strips without crowding the catch; 2 + 2 keeps the catch on a full wall. One 4-wire slot is possible if Q-OD ≤ 0.8 | Original |

### Pending measurements for the I2C spacer (Jason: caliper and photo)

| ID | Dimension | Value | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PINK-STRIP | Pico header plastic strips: height above the Pico face (fills PINK-P18b), inner-edge distance from the board centreline, and where each strip ends near the non-USB edge | | cal (pending) | SP-PLATE uses the H1 envelope until then |
| PINK-FACE | Is the Pico's LCD-facing face clear between the strips within 5 mm of the non-USB edge? | | look + photo (pending) | The model assumes a bare face |
| Q-1 | Connector is a Qwiic / STEMMA QT 4-pin JST-SH | | look (pending) | Jason believes so; unconfirmed |
| Q-OD | Each wire's outside diameter, and the arrangement (loose, bonded flat, twisted) | | cal (pending) | SP-WIRE assumes ≤ 1.0 |
| Q-PLUG | Plug housing W × H × L | | cal (pending) | For the external holder |
| OPT-1 | OPTIGA Trust M breakout: L × W × T, connector position, mounting holes, tallest part | | cal (pending) | For the external holder |
| PINK-PINS | Which header positions carry 3V3, GND and the firmware's SDA and SCL | | silkscreen + firmware (pending) | Optional; the wires are independent of the part. L9 (LCD back parts) also still pending |
